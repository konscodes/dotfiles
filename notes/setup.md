## Setup notes for a new system
Ideally this needs to become a script in a future that will deploy the packages and settings automatically depending on the OS.

### Packages to install
1. [ghq](https://www.notion.so/konscodes/Peco-and-ghq-for-repo-management-f51261a30456423fa8e0827631bc6943?pvs=4) for git repo management

### Settings
1. Add symlink for ```python``` to point to ```python3```
    ```bash
    ln -s python3 /bin/usr/python
    ```

### TO DO
- [ ] setup nvim to wrap the text for .md files
- [ ] finish the list in the correct order
- [ ] add an actual script part of this note
